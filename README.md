# Poem-generator
This project generates original, poem-like text inspired by Shakespeare’s writing style using an LSTM-based deep learning model. Trained on Shakespeare’s works, it mimics his vocabulary and tone. Users can adjust text length and creativity with provided parameters, and a pretrained model is included for quick use.
